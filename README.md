Created as a final project for my EE2325 class; hardware design was created by my partner Trevor Spurbeck

This project utilized the concepts learned from the class semester to create a functional musical keyboard using the provided materials of the Arduino kit.

Primary code functionality and buzzer subroutines were created by me, all programmed in the Assembly language
